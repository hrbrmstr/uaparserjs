Description: Despite there being a section in RFC 7231
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3> defining a suggested
    structure for 'User-Agent' headers this data is notoriously difficult
    to parse consistently. Tools are provided that will take in user agent
    strings and return structured R objects. This is a 'V8'-backed package
    based on the 'ua-parser' project <https://github.com/ua-parser>.
